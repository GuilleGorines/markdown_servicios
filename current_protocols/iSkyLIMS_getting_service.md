# How to accept a service on iSkyLIMS
Welcome to this quick guide on how to accept a service on iSkyLIMS!

First of all is **entering [iSkyLIMS](https://iskylims.isciii.es/)**. This can be done only from the local ISCIII network, following the previous link: [https://iskylims.isciii.es/](https://iskylims.isciii.es/).

Once there, you need to **log in**. To do so, fill the _User name_ and _Password_ blocks in the main page and press the _Login_ button. Make sure your password and username are correct!

Once logged in, let's move to the services section by pressing the _Requesting Services_ section.

This will take you to the _Requesting Services Application_. Here, you can spot two main lists: 
* **Recorded services**: the ones that have not been assigned yet, with some related data (Service identification number, Requesting center, and Requesting investigator).

* **In progress services**: the ones that have been assigned, but not yet finished. This table also displays relevant data, particularly the Service identification number, the Requesting center, and the expected delivery date.  

To accept a service, go to the _Manage Services_ dropdown, and choose the _Pending services_ option.

Inside _Pending services_ you will be able to access the _Recorded Services_ tab. Here, you will see all the currently recorded services. To access each of them, press on their Service identification number (labeled as Services Request ID).

Once inside a service, you will find all data related to it, such as who requested it, date of creation, whether or not they uploaded a file (sometimes needed, depending on the service), or some notes by the requesting investigator. 

Always make sure you know what is being asked before accepting a service (just to avoid mess). You should not accept a service unless you can see all the samples in the _Samples in Service_ tab. If none have been selected, click on _Add new samples_, and search for the corresponding name in the list. Mark the "Select sample" column for the desired samples, then click _Submit your request_. This will associate the chosen samples with the service. 

When you have made sure that all samples are recorded, and there's nothing weird or wrong about this service, we are ready to accept it!
To do so, click on _Add Resolution_.

To accept a service, which is the same as **creating a resolution** for it, fill the form with:

* **Estimated resolution date**: this should be long enough to finish the service comfortably, and take into account any possible inconveniencies.

* **Acronym Service Name**: each service will need its own, unique, acronym. The acronym for this will vary depending on what to do in this specific service. It must always be followed by a number, so that we can differentiate between services where we perform the same protocol on different samples.

* **Assign to user**: the user that will be assigned with this service. This allows both getting a service for yourself, or for anyone else you want.
*
